## The Problem

Building applications that work with email is surprisingly difficult. Developers face multiple challenges:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complex Protocols" icon="server">
    Email relies on protocols designed decades ago. IMAP for reading, SMTP for sending, and each with their own authentication methods, connection handling, and edge cases. These protocols were not designed for modern applications or AI agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure Burden" icon="building">
    To handle email reliably, you need to manage mail servers, deal with DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), handle bounces, maintain reputation, and ensure deliverability. This is a full-time job, not a feature.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Real-Time Capabilities" icon="clock">
    Traditional email doesn't push notifications. You have to poll for new messages, wasting resources and adding latency. For AI agents that need to respond quickly, this is a dealbreaker.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not Built for AI" icon="robot">
    AI applications need programmatic access to emails—reading, parsing, responding, and organizing messages automatically. Existing email services are built for humans clicking buttons, not agents making API calls.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Solution

Jasni abstracts all email complexity into a simple REST API. You focus on building your application while we handle the infrastructure.
