## The Vision

AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks. But there's a fundamental limitation: they lack their own communication channel. They can't independently reach out to services, respond to people, or coordinate with other agents.

Email is the universal protocol—everyone has it, every service supports it. Jasni gives your AI agents their own email identity, enabling them to communicate autonomously with the entire digital world.

## The Challenge

Giving AI agents email capabilities isn't straightforward. Here's what you'd face building it yourself:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legacy Protocols" icon="server">
    Email uses protocols from the 1980s—IMAP for reading, SMTP for sending. Each has complex authentication, connection management, and countless edge cases. These were designed for humans at terminals, not autonomous agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure Complexity" icon="building">
    Running reliable email requires mail servers, DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), bounce handling, reputation management, and deliverability monitoring. It's an entire discipline, not a quick integration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Native Real-Time" icon="clock">
    Email wasn't built for instant responses. Without webhooks, you're stuck polling—wasting resources and adding latency. For agents that need to react in seconds, this is unacceptable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Human-Centric Design" icon="robot">
    Email clients are built for humans clicking buttons. AI agents need programmatic access—APIs to read, parse, respond, and organize messages automatically. This layer doesn't exist out of the box.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Jasni: Email Identity for AI

Jasni abstracts all email complexity into a simple REST API. Give your agents a dedicated inbox and let them communicate with the world.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent-First API" icon="code">
    Send, receive, reply, and forward—all through clean REST endpoints. No IMAP connections, no SMTP configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Reactions" icon="bolt">
    Webhooks notify your agent the moment an email arrives. No polling, no delays—respond in seconds.

  <Card title="Developer Experience" icon="laptop-code">
    TypeScript and Python SDKs with full type support. Clear documentation. Predictable, consistent responses.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Inbox for Your Agent">
    Set up a dedicated email address for your AI agent—either with your custom domain or connect an existing account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the API">
    Use simple HTTP requests or our SDKs to send, receive, reply, and manage emails programmatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="React in Real-Time">
    Configure webhooks to notify your agent instantly when emails arrive. Your agent can read, process, and respond autonomously.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can Build

Jasni enables a new category of autonomous AI applications:

- **Autonomous AI Agents**: Agents with their own email identity that can independently communicate with services, people, and other agents
- **Intelligent Customer Support**: AI that handles inquiries, gathers context, and resolves issues—all via email
- **Automated Workflows**: Parse incoming invoices, extract data, schedule meetings, update CRMs—triggered by email
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enable your AI agents to collaborate with each other through email threads
- **Service Integrations**: Let your agents interact with any service that accepts email (which is almost everything)
