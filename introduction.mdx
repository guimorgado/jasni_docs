## The Vision

AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks. But there's a fundamental limitation: they lack their own communication channel. They can't independently reach out to services, respond to people, or coordinate with other agents.

Email is the universal protocol—everyone has it, every service supports it. Jasni gives your AI agents their own email identity, enabling them to communicate autonomously with the entire digital world.

## Why Gmail Breaks for AI Agents

You can give agents access to Gmail. The question is whether you *should*.

Gmail works... until you need 10, 50, or 100 agent inboxes. Here's why human email infrastructure doesn't scale for autonomous agents:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legacy Protocols" icon="server">
    Gmail was never designed for autonomous agents. Under the hood, it still relies on IMAP/SMTP—protocols from the 1980s with complex authentication, fragile connections, and endless edge cases. 
    
    You can make it work, but you'll spend weeks fighting infrastructure instead of building agents.

    **The cost:** Slower development, brittle integrations, and constant maintenance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure Complexity" icon="building">
    Running reliable email requires mail servers, DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), bounce handling, reputation management, and deliverability monitoring. 
    
    This is manageable for one inbox. It becomes a nightmare when you need one inbox per agent, per project, or per customer.

    **The cost:** Weeks of DevOps work that has nothing to do with your agent's intelligence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Real-Time" icon="clock">
    Email wasn't built for instant responses. Without webhooks, you're stuck polling—wasting resources and adding latency. Gmail's push notifications are unreliable and complex to set up.
    
    For agents that need to react in seconds, this delay is unacceptable.

    **The cost:** Slow agents that feel unresponsive, missed SLAs, and poor user experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Identity Mismatch" icon="user-xmark">
    Gmail accounts represent humans. AI agents are non-human actors with different lifecycles, permissions, and responsibilities.

    Mixing both leads to:
    - **Shared credentials** that create security vulnerabilities
    - **Confusing audit logs** where human and agent actions blend together
    - **Permission chaos** when agents need access to human inboxes
    - **Hard-to-debug behavior** when you can't tell who did what

    **The cost:** Security risks, compliance headaches, and agents that feel bolted-on rather than native.
  </Accordion>

<Note>
  **Email isn't the problem.** Using human email for agents is. Your agents deserve their own identity—purpose-built for autonomous operation.

## Jasni: Email Built for Agents

Jasni gives each agent its own email identity—a dedicated inbox designed for autonomous operation, not retrofitted from human tools.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent-First API" icon="code">
    Send, receive, reply, and forward—all through clean REST endpoints. No IMAP connections, no SMTP configuration. Ship in hours, not weeks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Reactions" icon="bolt">
    Webhooks notify your agent the moment an email arrives. No polling, no delays—your agents respond in seconds, not minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale Without Pain" icon="layer-group">
    Spin up 10 or 1,000 inboxes with the same API call. One inbox per agent, per project, per customer—no infrastructure overhead.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Identity Separation" icon="fingerprint">
    Each agent gets its own credentials, its own audit trail, its own permissions. No more mixing human and agent actions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Inbox for Your Agent">
    Set up a dedicated email address for your AI agent—either with your custom domain or connect an existing account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the API">
    Use simple HTTP requests or our SDKs to send, receive, reply, and manage emails programmatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="React in Real-Time">
    Configure webhooks to notify your agent instantly when emails arrive. Your agent can read, process, and respond autonomously.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can Build

Jasni enables a new category of autonomous AI applications:

- **Autonomous AI Agents**: Agents with their own email identity that can independently communicate with services, people, and other agents
- **Intelligent Customer Support**: AI that handles inquiries, gathers context, and resolves issues—all via email
- **Automated Workflows**: Parse incoming invoices, extract data, schedule meetings, update CRMs—triggered by email
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enable your AI agents to collaborate with each other through email threads
- **Service Integrations**: Let your agents interact with any service that accepts email (which is almost everything)
