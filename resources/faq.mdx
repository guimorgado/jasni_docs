  <Accordion title="What is Jasni?">
    Jasni is an email infrastructure platform built specifically for AI agents. Unlike traditional email services designed for humans, Jasni gives each AI agent its own email identity: a dedicated inbox designed for autonomous operation.

    With Jasni, your agents can send, receive, reply, and forward emails through a clean REST API. No IMAP connections, no SMTP configuration. Just simple HTTP requests that let you ship in hours, not weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Jasni different from services like SendGrid or Mailgun?">
    SendGrid and Mailgun are primarily transactional email services. They excel at sending large volumes of one-way emails (newsletters, notifications, marketing campaigns).

    Jasni is built for **two-way autonomous communication**:

    - **Full inbox management**: Your agents can receive, read, and respond to emails, not just send them
    - **Agent-first design**: Purpose-built for AI agents with their own identity, not retrofitted human tools
    - **Real-time webhooks**: Instant notifications when emails arrive, so your agents can react in seconds
    - **Thread management**: Native support for email conversations, replies, and forwarding
    - **Scale without infrastructure**: Spin up 10 or 1,000 inboxes with the same API call

    Think of it this way: SendGrid/Mailgun is for *broadcasting*, Jasni is for *conversing*.

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own custom domain to send emails?">
    Yes! You can configure custom domains so your AI agents send emails from addresses like `agent@yourdomain.com` instead of a generic address.

    To set up a custom domain:

    1. Go to **Domains** in your [dashboard](https://app.jasni.ai)
    2. Add your domain and configure the required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
    3. Verify your domain
    4. Start sending from your branded addresses

    Custom domains improve deliverability, build trust with recipients, and maintain your brand identity. See our [Custom Domains Guide](/guides/domains/creating-custom-domains) for detailed setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best way to process incoming emails?">
    The recommended approach is to use **webhooks**. Instead of constantly polling for new emails, webhooks notify your agent instantly when something happens.

    Here's how it works:

    1. Register a webhook endpoint with the events you care about (e.g., `email.received`)
    2. When an email arrives, Jasni sends a POST request to your endpoint with the full email data
    3. Your agent processes the email and can respond immediately

    This approach is resource-efficient (no wasted polling cycles), fast (reactions in seconds), and reliable (automatic retries if your endpoint fails).

    Check out our [Webhooks Guide](/webhooks/overview) to get started.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make sure I don't end up in spam?">
    Email deliverability depends on proper authentication. Make sure you have configured:

    1. **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Authorizes Jasni to send emails on behalf of your domain
    2. **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Adds a digital signature to verify emails haven't been tampered with
    3. **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)**: Tells receiving servers how to handle emails that fail authentication

    Additionally, follow these best practices:
    - Verify your sending domain before sending
    - Avoid spammy content and maintain list hygiene
    - Start with a warm-up period for new domains
    - Monitor your domain reputation

    See our [SPF, DKIM, DMARC Guide](/resources/security/spf-dkim-dmarc) for detailed configuration instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you have SDKs available?">
    Yes! We provide official SDKs for:

    - **[TypeScript/JavaScript](/sdks/typescript/overview)**: Full-featured SDK for Node.js and browser environments
    - **[Python](/sdks/python/overview)**: Full-featured SDK with async support

    We also offer an **[MCP Server](/sdks/mcp/overview)** that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with email directly.

    You can always use our REST API directly from any programming language if you prefer.
