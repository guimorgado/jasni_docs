## Overview

Using a custom domain allows your AI agents to send emails from addresses like `agent@yourdomain.com` instead of a generic address. This improves deliverability, builds trust with recipients, and maintains your brand identity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Access to your domain's DNS settings
- A verified Jasni account
- Administrative access to your Jasni workspace

## Step 1: Add Your Domain

Navigate to your [Jasni Dashboard](https://app.jasni.ai) and add your domain:

1. Go to **Domains** (under the Mail section in the sidebar)
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Click **Continue**

<Info>
  You can add multiple domains to a single Jasni account.
</Info>

## Step 2: Configure DNS Records

After adding your domain, you'll need to configure several DNS records for authentication and deliverability.

### SPF Record

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) authorizes Jasni to send emails on behalf of your domain.

| Type | Host | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| TXT | @ | `v=spf1 include:_spf.jasni.ai ~all` |

<Warning>
  If you already have an SPF record, add `include:_spf.jasni.ai` to your existing record instead of creating a new one. Multiple SPF records can cause delivery issues.
</Warning>

### DKIM Records

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) adds a digital signature to verify your emails haven't been tampered with.

| Type | Host | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | `jasni1._domainkey` | `jasni1._domainkey.jasni.ai` |
| CNAME | `jasni2._domainkey` | `jasni2._domainkey.jasni.ai` |

### DMARC Record

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) tells receiving servers how to handle emails that fail authentication.

| Type | Host | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| TXT | `_dmarc` | `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com` |

<Tip>
  Start with `p=none` during setup, then move to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` once you've confirmed everything works correctly.
</Tip>

### MX Records (for receiving)

If you want to receive emails through Jasni, add these MX records:

| Type | Host | Priority | Value |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| MX | @ | 10 | `mx1.jasni.ai` |
| MX | @ | 20 | `mx2.jasni.ai` |

## Step 3: Verify Your Domain

Once your DNS records are configured:

1. Return to **Domains** in your dashboard
2. Click on your domain
3. Click **Verify DNS**

<Note>
  DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though it typically completes within a few hours. You can check propagation status using tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).
</Note>

### Verification Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | DNS records not yet detected |
| Partial | Some records verified, others pending |
| Verified | All records verified, domain ready to use |
| Failed | Incorrect DNS configuration detected |

## Step 4: Create Email Addresses

Once verified, you can create email addresses on your domain:

```typescript
// Your agents can now send from your domain
await jasni.emails.send({
  from: 'support@yourdomain.com',
  to: 'customer@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  text: 'Thanks for signing up!'
})
```

## Subdomain Configuration

You can also configure subdomains for different purposes:

| Subdomain | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `notifications.yourdomain.com` | Automated notifications |
| `support.yourdomain.com` | Customer support agents |
| `marketing.yourdomain.com` | Marketing communications |

This helps with email organization and allows different sending reputations for different email types.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS records not verifying">
    - Ensure there are no typos in the DNS records
    - Check that you're adding records to the correct domain/subdomain
    - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
    - Use a DNS checker tool to verify records are visible
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emails going to spam">
    - Verify all DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) are correctly configured
    - Start with a warm-up period for new domains
    - Ensure email content follows best practices
    - Check your domain isn't on any blocklists
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DMARC failures">
    - Ensure SPF and DKIM are properly configured
    - Check DMARC reports for alignment issues
    - Verify you're sending from an authorized address
  </Accordion>
