```

## Webhook Event

When an email is deleted, an `email.deleted` webhook event is dispatched:

```json
{
  "event": "email.deleted",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "12345",
    "account": "you@domain.com"
  }
}
```

## Behavior

<Warning>
  Deleting an email is permanent and cannot be undone. The email is marked for deletion and expunged from the mailbox.
</Warning>

Depending on your email provider's configuration, deleted emails may:
- Be moved to a Trash folder
- Be permanently deleted immediately

## Use Cases

### Cleanup Automation

Automatically delete processed emails:

```javascript
async function cleanupProcessedEmails(processedIds) {
  for (const uid of processedIds) {
    await fetch(
      `https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/emails/${uid}?account=you@domain.com`,
      {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer jsk_your_api_key',
        },
      }
    );
  }
}
```

### Spam Removal

Delete confirmed spam emails:

```javascript
async function deleteSpam(email) {
  const isSpam = await spamDetector.check(email);
  
  if (isSpam.confidence > 0.95) {
    await fetch(
      `https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/emails/${email.uid}?account=you@domain.com`,
      {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer jsk_your_api_key',
        },
      }
    );
    
    console.log(`Deleted spam email: ${email.subject}`);
  }
}
```

## Notes

- The `id` must be a valid integer representing the email's UID
- The `account` parameter is required
- Ensure you have the correct folder specified if the email is not in INBOX
- Consider using the update endpoint to mark as read instead of deleting if you want to keep records
