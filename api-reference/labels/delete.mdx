<Warning>
  **This action is permanent and cannot be undone.** All email-label associations for this label will be removed.
</Warning>

## Behavior

When you delete a label:

1. **Label removed**: The label is permanently deleted
2. **Associations removed**: All email-label associations are cascade deleted
3. **Emails unchanged**: The emails themselves are not affected

## Notes

- You can only delete labels that belong to you
- Consider updating emails to use a different label before deleting
- The emails that had this label will simply no longer have it
