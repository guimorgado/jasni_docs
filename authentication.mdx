## API Keys

All API requests to Jasni require authentication using an API key. Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure.

<Warning>
  **Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.** Always use environment variables or secure vaults for storing API keys.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to your dashboard">
    Go to [app.jasni.ai](https://app.jasni.ai) and sign in to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click on **Settings** → **API Keys** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a descriptive name, and copy the generated key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  API keys start with `jsk_` followed by a unique identifier. For example: `jsk_live_abc123xyz...`
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request using the Bearer scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer jsk_your_api_key
```

### Example Request

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/emails \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer jsk_your_api_key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/emails', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer jsk_your_api_key',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/emails',
        headers={
            'Authorization': 'Bearer jsk_your_api_key',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Rate Limiting

To protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage, Jasni implements rate limiting:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|
| Free | 100 requests/minute |
| Pro | 1,000 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your code to handle rate limits gracefully.
</Tip>

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Missing or invalid API key:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized. Please provide a valid API key."
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

The API key doesn't have permission for the requested operation:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Forbidden. Your API key does not have access to this resource."
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="lock">
    Store your API key in environment variables instead of hardcoding it:
    
    ```bash
    export JASNI_API_KEY="jsk_your_api_key"
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.JASNI_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="rotate">
    Create new API keys periodically and revoke old ones. This limits the impact if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for different environments" icon="layer-group">
    Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production. This allows you to revoke keys without affecting all environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly check your API usage in the dashboard to detect any unusual activity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Revoking API Keys

If you suspect an API key has been compromised:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke** to immediately disable it
4. Create a new API key and update your applications

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key is immediate and irreversible. All requests using that key will fail instantly.
</Warning>
