## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in your Jasni account. Instead of polling the API for changes, webhooks push data to your server instantly when something happens.

<Note>
  Webhooks are essential for building responsive AI email agents that need to react immediately to incoming emails.

curl -X POST https://api.jasni.ai/api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer jsk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/jasni",
    "events": ["email.received", "email.sent"]
  }'
