## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are the nervous system of your AI agent. They deliver real-time HTTP notifications the moment something happens in your agent's inbox—a new email arrives, a message bounces, or an email is marked as spam.

<Note>
  Webhooks are what transform your AI from a passive system that checks email periodically into an active agent that responds instantly.

    "events": ["email.received", "email.sent"]
  }'
