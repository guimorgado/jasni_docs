## Overview

An inbox in Jasni represents a connected email account. Before you can send or receive emails through the API, you need to connect at least one inbox.

<Note>
  Each inbox is linked to your Jasni user account. You can connect multiple inboxes and manage them all through a single API key.
</Note>

## Connecting an Inbox

You can connect an inbox in two ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Connect Existing Account" icon="link">
    Link your existing email account (Gmail, Outlook, or any IMAP provider)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create New Account" icon="plus">
    Create a new email address using your custom domain hosted on Jasni
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Inbox Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `email` | string | The email address of the inbox |
| `name` | string | Display name for the account |
| `provider` | string | Email provider (gmail, outlook, imap) |
| `status` | string | Connection status (active, error, disconnected) |
| `created_at` | datetime | When the inbox was connected |

## Folders

Each inbox contains standard email folders:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `INBOX` | Incoming emails |
| `Sent` | Sent emails |
| `Drafts` | Draft emails |
| `Trash` | Deleted emails |
| `Spam` / `Junk` | Spam folder |

<Tip>
  Folder names may vary by provider. Jasni normalizes common folders, but custom folders use their original names.
</Tip>

## Multiple Inboxes

You can connect multiple inboxes to your Jasni account. When making API calls, specify which inbox to use with the `account` parameter:

```bash
GET /api/v1/emails?account=support@yourcompany.com&folder=INBOX
```

```bash
GET /api/v1/emails?account=sales@yourcompany.com&folder=INBOX
```
