## Overview

An inbox in Jasni is the email identity for your AI agent. It's a dedicated address from which your agent can send, receive, and act on emails autonomously—communicating with services, people, and other agents.

<Note>
  Each inbox is linked to your Jasni account. You can create multiple inboxes for different agents or purposes, all managed through a single API key.
</Note>

## Creating an Agent Inbox

You can set up an inbox for your agent in two ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create New Identity" icon="plus">
    Create a fresh email address with your custom domain—a clean identity for your agent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connect Existing Account" icon="link">
    Link an existing email account (Gmail, Outlook, or any IMAP provider) to give your agent access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Inbox Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `email` | string | The agent's email address |
| `name` | string | Display name (e.g., "Support Agent", "Booking Assistant") |
| `provider` | string | Email provider (gmail, outlook, imap, jasni) |
| `status` | string | Connection status (active, error, disconnected) |
| `created_at` | datetime | When the inbox was created |

## Folders

Each inbox contains standard email folders:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `INBOX` | Incoming emails your agent can process |
| `Sent` | Emails your agent has sent |
| `Drafts` | Draft emails |
| `Trash` | Deleted emails |
| `Spam` / `Junk` | Spam folder |

<Tip>
  Folder names may vary by provider. Jasni normalizes common folders, but custom folders retain their original names.
</Tip>

## Multiple Agents, Multiple Inboxes

You can create dedicated inboxes for different agents or purposes. Specify which inbox to use with the `account` parameter:

```bash
# Support agent inbox
GET /api/v1/emails?account=support-agent@yourcompany.com&folder=INBOX
```

```bash
# Sales agent inbox
GET /api/v1/emails?account=sales-agent@yourcompany.com&folder=INBOX
```
