## Overview

Drafts allow you to save email messages before sending them. This is useful for composing emails over time, scheduling sends, or building approval workflows.

## Draft Structure

A draft has the same structure as a message, stored in the Drafts folder:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `uid` | integer | Unique identifier within the mailbox |
| `from` | string | Sender email address |
| `to` | string[] | Recipient email addresses |
| `cc` | string[] | CC recipients |
| `bcc` | string[] | BCC recipients |
| `subject` | string | Email subject line |
| `text` | string | Plain text body |
| `html` | string | HTML body |
| `attachments` | object[] | List of attachments |

## Operations

### Create a Draft

Save a new draft:

```json
POST /api/v1/emails/drafts
{
  "account": "you@domain.com",
  "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
  "subject": "Work in progress",
  "text": "This is a draft I'm working on...",
  "html": "<p>This is a draft I'm working on...</p>"
}
```

### List Drafts

Retrieve all drafts:

```bash
GET /api/v1/emails?account=you@domain.com&folder=Drafts
```

### Update a Draft

Modify an existing draft:

```json
PUT /api/v1/emails/drafts/123
{
  "account": "you@domain.com",
  "to": ["recipient@example.com", "another@example.com"],
  "subject": "Updated subject",
  "text": "Updated content..."
}
```

### Send a Draft

Convert a draft into a sent email:

```json
POST /api/v1/emails/drafts/123/send
{
  "account": "you@domain.com"
}
```

<Note>
  When you send a draft, it is automatically moved from the Drafts folder to Sent.
</Note>

### Delete a Draft

Remove a draft without sending:

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/emails/drafts/123?account=you@domain.com
```

## AI Agent Workflow Example

A common pattern for AI email agents:

```javascript
async function handleIncomingEmail(email) {
  // 1. AI generates a response
  const aiResponse = await generateAIResponse(email);
  
  // 2. Save as draft for human review
  const draft = await jasni.drafts.create({
    account: 'support@yourcompany.com',
    to: [email.from],
    subject: `Re: ${email.subject}`,
    text: aiResponse.text,
    html: aiResponse.html
  });
  
  // 3. Notify team for review
  await notifyTeam({
    message: 'New AI draft ready for review',
    draftId: draft.uid,
    originalEmail: email.subject
  });
  
  // 4. Team reviews and either edits or approves
  // 5. Send the draft when approved
}
```
